ViseHub V2 – Final Release
I’m dropping ViseHub V2 today — not because I planned some big comeback, but because I’m done.

To be real with you, I’ve lost all motivation. I’ve hit a point where I can’t keep pushing myself to work on something I no longer enjoy. My mental health has taken a serious hit over the past few months, and trying to keep up with everything here has only made it worse.

I’ve poured everything I had left into V2 — it’s the cleanest, most solid version I could manage before stepping away. I don’t want this to just disappear, so I’m leaving it here for anyone who still finds it useful.

After this, I’m quitting Discord. I need to take care of myself for once.

Thanks to everyone who supported me up to this point. I appreciate you more than you know.
